;SFX samples. 
;BRRs usually start off with a header byte followed by eight bytes of silence ($00) in order to circumvent
;a bug in the SPC chip that causes a popping sound if a sample is interrupted by new sample data, as it basically
;makes the pop silent as a workaround. Note that this header byte can be $00 too!
